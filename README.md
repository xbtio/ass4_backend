### CAUTION
**PRODUCT AND OFFERS LINK DOESN'T WORK ON [https://ass4-backend.onrender.com] BECAUSE RENDER SERVER MAKE TOO MUCH REQUESTS AND KASPI API BLOCKS IP OF RENDER SERVER (gives 429 error).
TO FULLY TEST I RECOMMEND RUNNING LOCALLY. BESIDES THIS ALL OTHER FUNCTIONS WORK PROPERLY ON A DEPLOYED SITE**

### Installation
    git clone
    npm install
    node app.js
    go to http://localhost:3000

### Key Features
The registration and login functionalities for users have been implemented on the respective register and login routes.
To access admin panel you have to enter "/admin" url. **Login: admin  Password: admin**\n
I have used Kaspi API for retrieving products and quickchart to show charts for each product
In Product and Offers you can search any product you want.



### Deployment
The application is deployed using the service render.com
[https://ass4-backend.onrender.com]


(!!!) Due to the free subscription plan on this resource, the first connection to my application may take some time.
