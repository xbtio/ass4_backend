Key Features

    The registration and login functionalities for users have been implemented on the respective register and login routes.
    Upon entering the credentials: username: "admin", password: "admin", you will be redirected to the admin panel ("/admin"), where you can monitor and manage users and items.
    I have used Kaspi API for retrieving products and quickchart to show charts for each product
    In Product and Offers you can search any product you want.

Deployment

    The application is deployed using the service render.com
    [https://ass4-backend.onrender.com]

(!!!) Due to the free subscription plan on this resource, the first connection to my application may take some time.
